# GVLM Dataset

The Global Very-High-Resolution Landslde Mapping (GVLM) dataset is the first large-scale and open-source VHR landslide mapping dataset. It is available for free to researchers for only non-commercial use. 

# Description
It includes 17 bitemporal very-high-resolution imagery pairs with a spatial resolution of 0.59 m acquired via Google Earth service. Each sub-dataset contains a pair of bitemporal images and the corresponding ground-truth map. The total coverage of the dataset is 163.77 $km2$. The landslide sites in different geographical locations have various sizes, shapes, occurrence times, spatial distributions, phenology states, and land cover types, resulting in considerable spectral heterogeneity and intensity variations in the remote sensing imagery. It can be used to develop and evaluate machine/deep learning models for change detection, semantic segmentation and landslide extraction.
